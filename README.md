### Yet Another Image Scraper

This is a simple but ambitious image scraper. I need of it to scrape form multiple search engines. (Now only from bing). It uses Selenium. 

Now It uses:
* bing
* duckduckgo
* picsearch 

Other search engine will come. 

It can be used in headless mode. 

When possible I will add an AI based categorization to avoid 'categories mismatch'.
